# SwiftPractice3
This Swift code is like a little adventure game where two players explore a grid, picking up treasures along the way. They're represented by emojis on the board, and there are goodies like diamonds, money bags, keys, and even crates scattered around. The players move around by typing commands (like "up", "down", "left", or "right"), and whenever they land on a treasure, they automatically pick it up. The game keeps track of what each player collects, and at the end, it shows who scored what. It's a fun way to see how Swift handles managing a game board, player movement, and inventory tracking
